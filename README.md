This repository contains the Python code, model files, and presentation for the Resume Data Extraction and Analysis project. The project aims to extract and analyze information from resumes using machine learning techniques.

Project Structure

aap.py: Main Python script for resume data extraction and analysis.

model.pkl: Trained machine learning model for the project.

presentation.ppt: Project presentation with insights and results.

sample_resumes/: A folder containing sample resumes (anonymized) to illustrate the data format.

Data

Due to the large volume of resumes used in this project, the full dataset is not uploaded to this repository. A few anonymized sample resumes are provided for demonstration purposes.
